# ðŸ›¡ Aegis

A tool to convert TypeScript interfaces to JSON Decoders [nvie/decoders](https://github.com/nvie/decoders)

## How to use

`aegis` is currently in alpha and not yet released to NPM.
Just clone the repo if you want to give it a try!

Here are some steps to get you going:
1) Install dependencies:

`yarn install`

2) Transpile typescript:

`yarn tsc`

3) Run the decoder generator:

`node ./lib/index.js generate --inputPath [INPUT_PATH] --outputFile [OUTPUT_FILE]`

## Example

Usage of the tool requires a single directory with the Typescript types you want to create decoders for (can be `export default` or `export`). Use this as your import path for the command shown above.

An example of this can be found in the [`example`](./example) directory. The correct compilation command here would be:

`node ./lib/index.js generate --inputPath ./example --outputFile example.ts`

After running this command, you will be greeted with an `example.ts` file in the root of this repository, containing the generated decoders
